Not sure where all your time goes? I wasn't either, so this application generates a pop-up box every 15 minutes (configurable) for me to entry what I'm working on

<div style="text-align: center;">

###### [https://github.com/Bilbottom/billiam-database](https://github.com/Bilbottom/billiam-database)

In addition to my 'automated' timesheet (the project above), I also keep track of every transaction I make at an item level (since 2018-01-18)

This project is both a [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) proof-of-concept, plus a means for me to analyse my spending and work
