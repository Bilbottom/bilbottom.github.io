## [<img alt="dbt-labs" height="18px" src="https://www.getdbt.com/favicon.ico"> Life Admin using dbt](https://github.com/Bilbottom/billiam-database)

###### [https://github.com/Bilbottom/billiam-database](https://github.com/Bilbottom/billiam-database)

In addition to my 'automated' timesheet (the project above), I also keep track of every transaction I make at an item level (since 2018-01-18)

This project is both a [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) proof-of-concept, plus a means for me to analyse my spending and work

Current lineage diagram:

## [<img alt="Microsoft Excel" height="18px" src="https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico"> Custom Excel Add-In](https://github.com/Bilbottom/vba-projects/tree/main/personal-toolkit)

###### [https://github.com/Bilbottom/vba-projects/tree/main/personal-toolkit](https://github.com/Bilbottom/vba-projects/tree/main/personal-toolkit)

Excel will never go away... So let's enriched it with some quality-of-life features wrapped up into a handy custom ribbon tab (in addition to the millions of features that Excel already has).

The features are built using VBA and the custom ribbon tab is added using the **Office RibbonX Editor** available at:

## [üìò VBA Guide](https://github.com/Bilbottom/vba-guide)

###### [https://github.com/Bilbottom/vba-guide](https://github.com/Bilbottom/vba-guide)

> This will probably not be updated any more

Can you tell I like VBA? Well, I want you to like it too -- so this is a reference material for getting started with VBA. The guide is written in LaTeX, but you can find the latest compiled version at:

- https://github.com/Bilbottom/vba-guide/blob/main/compiled/vba-guide.pdf

It was originally written for some former colleagues and has been slightly adapted for a more general audience, but probably not enough. If you want to see some VBA videos, I strongly recommend [the WiseOwl YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WiseOwlTutorials) tutorials:

## [üîÅ Mathematics Textbook on Algebraic Permutations](https://github.com/Bilbottom/permutations)

###### [https://github.com/Bilbottom/permutations](https://github.com/Bilbottom/permutations)

> Not really in development any more (and not even finished)

There's a branch of Maths called Linear Algebra, and one of the concepts that you can study is _permutations_:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation

They're a pretty simple concept, but learning about them becomes a pain because there's a lot of different --- and in some places, contradictory --- notation used to describe them and what they can do

The purpose of this project was to show all the different notations, where they differ, and how to solve problems using each of them
